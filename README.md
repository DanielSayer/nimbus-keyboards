# Nimbus Keyboards

This is a landing page for Nimbus Keyboards, it is an experimentation into Three.js and GSAP. I followed a tutorial to make this, however, it is modified to be more considerate of motion preferences.

## Running the project

This is a bun project.
There are no env vars and all assets are in the public folder.

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Motion

The project uses motion-safe classes to ensure that animations are not skipped or interrupted by the user's motion preferences.
If you have issues seeing the animations, ensure that your pc has animations enabled.
